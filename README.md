**Key Features**:

Data Sources: The project utilizes a comprehensive dataset encompassing critical information, including country codes, names, record dates, Human Development Index, daily COVID-19 cases and deaths, stringency index, population, and GDP per capita for various countries.

Top 10 Most Affected Countries: The analysis concentrates on the top 10 countries severely impacted by the pandemic, with a particular emphasis on the United States, Brazil, and India, which experienced high COVID-19 case numbers.

Mortality Analysis: The project presents insights into total COVID-19-related deaths among these countries, revealing variations in death rates relative to the total case count. Notably, India, Russia, and South Africa display comparatively lower death rates.

Stringency Index: An exploration of the stringency index provides valuable insights into how countries implemented measures such as school and workplace closures and travel bans to control the virus's spread. India's stringency index is highlighted for its effectiveness, while Mexico's is shown as lower in comparison.

**Economic Impact Analysis**:

**Conclusion**:

In conclusion, the analysis underscores the profound impact of COVID-19 on the global economy, with the United States being particularly affected due to its lower stringency index. The project highlights how GDP per capita and Human Development Index can serve as critical indicators of economic resilience during a crisis.
