The outbreak of COVID-19 brought about unprecedented challenges, causing significant disruptions to the global economy. This data analysis project delves into the profound impacts of COVID-19 on economies worldwide, focusing on the top 10 countries most affected by the pandemic.

**Key Features**:

Data Sources: The project utilizes a comprehensive dataset encompassing critical information, including country codes, names, record dates, Human Development Index, daily COVID-19 cases and deaths, stringency index, population, and GDP per capita for various countries.

Top 10 Most Affected Countries: The analysis concentrates on the top 10 countries severely impacted by the pandemic, with a particular emphasis on the United States, Brazil, and India, which experienced high COVID-19 case numbers.

Stringency Index: An exploration of the stringency index provides valuable insights into how countries implemented measures such as school and workplace closures and travel bans to control the virus's spread. India's stringency index is highlighted for its effectiveness, while Mexico's is shown as lower in comparison.

**Economic Impact Analysis**:

The project evaluates the economic impact of COVID-19 by examining GDP per capita before and during the pandemic. The visual representation of these data points demonstrates the substantial economic downturn experienced by all countries during the pandemic.

**Human Development Index**:

An analysis of the Human Development Index offers a perspective on how countries allocated resources to support education, healthcare, and overall economic growth during the pandemic. The United States and Brazil emerge as leaders in prioritizing human development during these challenging times.

**Conclusion**:

In conclusion, the analysis underscores the profound impact of COVID-19 on the global economy, with the United States being particularly affected due to its lower stringency index. The project highlights how GDP per capita and Human Development Index can serve as critical indicators of economic resilience during a crisis.
